## Session overview: 
- The Hawthorne Effect: Psychology :: Cerf Effect: Web Literacy
- Web as Sociotechnical Inrastructure 
- Start discussion around how to study web literacy as a sociotechnical infrastructure. One that Web Literacy Leaders have some experience observing and interpreting. 
- Future directions in studying the web literacy as sociotechnical infrastructure 

## Activity 1: Two Web Literacy Truths and a Lie ( 10 min)
In groups:

- Share two things you understood about the web literacy framework, and one thing you had to google. 
- Within your group - guess which is a lie and which are truths. 
- Were you embarassed by this at the time? Are you embarassed to share now? 
- Did you ask a friend or neighbor if they knew what this meant? 


## Activity Context (5 min)
What's the Point: Now imagine trying to measure what people don't know about the web. It's a measurement problem complicated by:

- Lack of standards (Web literacy is still emerging as a framwork, right? We're on WL 2.0 now...)
- Diverse populations
- And a diverse set of competencies

But I would argue its also a problem that is deeply complicated by people being embarassed about a concept that is technically complicated, broad in application, and consistent only in that it is always changing... 

I call this the Cerf Effect - after the TCP/IP inventor Vint Cerf. He once gave a talk where he admitted that a title like "grandfather of the internet" was a bit uncomfortable because he no longer understood basic mechanics of how the internet worked.People constantly ask him to fix things wrong with their browser, and he's embarassed by not knowing how. 

## The Web as a Sociotechnical Infrastructure (10 min)

One way to understand how people relate to a complicated phenomena like the web is to combine existing ideas  

I particularly like thinking about the web in terms of a `sociotechncial infrastructure`. 

Let's unpack the idea. 

The sociotechnical premise: The mutual constitution of people and technologies that are embedded in diverse political, economic, and geographic locales. You can't seperate people and technology and meaingfully interpret something that is sociotechnical. 

This may seem obvious: People learning the web are both constraiend by and empowered by this mutual consitution. 

Infrastructure: 

“A shared, evolving, heterogeneous installed base of IT capabilities developed on open and standardized interfaces” (Hanseth and Lyytinen 2008).

This seems (to me) like a helpful way of thinking about litercy on the web. A sociotechnical system that is powered by open and standardized interfaces. 

So, how might we learn from previous work on infrastructures to improve teaching, advocacy, and evaluation of web literacy?  

## Activity 2: Dimmensions of the Web as a Sociotechnical Infrastrcture (15 min)

According to Star and Ruhleder (1996), there are 8 dimensions of an infrastructure (defined in detail below). 

Individually - let's each choose one infrastructure dimmension. 

Try to use the dimmension to explain a context in which you are teaching, studying, or promoting web literacy: 

- Does this framing help? 
- Does it need additional consideration? 
- Can the defintions be expanded or improved for this particular setting? 


Dimmenions: 		
- **Embeddedness:** Infrastructure  is "sunk"  into, inside of,  other  structures, sodal  arrangements  and  technolo-gies
- **Transparency:** Infrastructure is transparent to use, inthe  sense  that  it  does  not  have  to  be  reinvented  eachtime or assembled  for  each task, but  invisibly  supports those tasks
- **Reach or scope:** This  may  be  either  spatial  or  tem-poral—infrastructure  has  reach  beyond  a  single  eventor one-site practice
- Learned as part of membership: Strangers  and  outsiders  encounter  infrastructure  as  atarget  object  to be learned  about.  New  participants ac-quire  a  naturalized  familiarity  with  its  objects  as  theybecome members
- **Links with conventions of practice:** . Infrastructure  bothshapes and  is shaped  by the conventions  of  a  commu-nity  of  practice,  e.g.  the  ways  that  cycles  of  day-nightwork  are  affected  by  and  affect  electrical  power  ratesand  needs.  Generations   of  typists  have  learned  theQWERTY keyboard; its limitations are inherited  by thecomputer keyboard and thence by the design  of today's computer  furniture. 
- **Embodiment of standards:** Modified  by scope and of-ten  by  conflicting  conventions,  infrastructure  takes  ontransparency by plugging into other infrastructures  andtools in a standardized  fashion 
- **Built on an installed base:** Infrastructure   does  notgrow  de novo:  it  wrestles  with  the  "inertia  of  the  in-stalled  base"  and  inherits  strengths  and  limitationsfrom   that  base.  Optical  fibers  run  along  old  rail-road  lines;  new  systems  are  designed  for  backward-compatibility;  and  failing  to  account  for  these  con-straints may be fatal  or distorting  to new  development processes.  
- **Becomes visible upon breakdown:**  The normally  invis-ible  quality  of  working  infrastructure  becomes  visiblewhen  it breaks; the  server  is down,  the bridge  washesout,  there  is  a  power  blackout.  Even  when  there  areback-up mechanisms or procedures, their existence  fur-ther highlights the now-visible  infrastructure. 

## Bringing this together
The compliations of web literacy are many. In this session we have tried to understand two: 

- The embarassment of not knowing
- The web as a sociotechnical infrastructure
