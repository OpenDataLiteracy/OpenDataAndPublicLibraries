Title: Why are Web Literacy Skills Necessary?

## Session overview: 

This session is about trying to understand - collectively - how to frame a hard problem like web literacy for stakeholders. I consistently face two challenges in teaching and advocating for web literacy: 

1. There are varying levels of literacy - often times a lack of understanding some aspect of the web is a source of embarrassment. 

2. The web is complex -  making sense of how people link into the web as an infrastructure for learning is an ongoing struggle.  

Some things we can do to frame this problem: 

- The Hawthorne Effect: Psychology:: Cerf Effect: Web Literacy
- Web as Sociotechnical Infrastructure - Web Literacy Leaders have some experience observing and interpreting, so does this help? 
- Future directions in studying the web literacy as sociotechnical infrastructure 

## Activity 1: Two Web Literacy Truths and a Lie ( 10 min)
In groups:

- Share two things you understood about the web literacy framework, and one thing you had to google. 
- Within your group - guess which is a lie and which are truths. 
- Were you embarrassed by this at the time? Are you embarrassed to share now? 
- Did you ask a friend or neighbor if they knew what this meant? 


## Activity Context (5 min)
What's the Point: Now imagine trying to measure what people don't know about the web. It's a measurement problem complicated by:

- Lack of standards (Web literacy is still emerging as a framework, right? We're on WL 2.0 now...)
- Diverse populations
- And a diverse set of competencies

But I would argue its also a problem that is deeply complicated by people being embarrassed about a concept that is technically complicated, broad in application, and consistent only in that it is always changing... 

I call this the Cerf Effect - after the TCP/IP inventor Vint Cerf. He once gave a talk where he admitted that a title like "grandfather of the internet" was a bit uncomfortable because he no longer understood basic mechanics of how the internet worked. People constantly ask him to fix things wrong with their browser, and he's embarrassed by not knowing how. 

## The Web as a Sociotechnical Infrastructure (10 min)

One way to understand how people relate to a complicated phenomena like the web is to combine existing ideas  

I particularly like thinking about the web in terms of a `sociotechncial infrastructure`. 

Let's unpack the idea. 

The sociotechnical premise: The mutual constitution of people and technologies that are embedded in diverse political, economic, and geographic locales. You can't separate people and technology and meaingfully interpret something that is sociotechnical. 

This may seem obvious: People learning the web are both constrained by and empowered by this mutual constitution. 

Infrastructure: 

“A shared, evolving, heterogeneous installed base of IT capabilities developed on open and standardized interfaces” (Hanseth and Lyytinen 2008).

This seems (to me) like a helpful way of thinking about literacy on the web. A sociotechnical system that is powered by open and standardized interfaces. 

So, how might we learn from previous work on infrastructures to improve teaching, advocacy, and evaluation of web literacy?  

## Activity 2: Dimensions of the Web as a Sociotechnical Infrastructure (15 min)

According to Star and Ruhleder (1996), there are 8 dimensions of an infrastructure (defined in detail below). 

Individually - let's each choose one infrastructure dimension. 

Try to use the dimension to explain a context in which you are teaching, studying, or promoting web literacy: 

- Does this framing help? 
- Does it need additional consideration? 
- Can the definitions be expanded or improved for this particular setting? 


Dimensions: 		
- **Embeddedness:** Infrastructure  is "sunk"  into, inside of,  other  structures, social  arrangements  and  technologies
- **Transparency:** Infrastructure is transparent to use, in the  sense  that  it  does  not  have  to  be  reinvented  each time or assembled  for  each task, but  invisibly  supports those tasks
- **Reach or scope:** This  may  be  either  spatial  or  temporal—infrastructure  has  reach  beyond  a  single  event or one-site practice
- Learned as part of membership: Strangers  and  outsiders  encounter  infrastructure  as  a target  object  to be learned  about.  New  participants ac-quire  a  naturalized  familiarity  with  its  objects  as  they become members
- **Links with conventions of practice:** . Infrastructure  both shapes and  is shaped  by the conventions  of  a  community  of  practice,  e.g.  the  ways  that  cycles  of  day-night work  are  affected  by  and  affect  electrical  power  rates and  needs.  Generations   of  typists  have  learned  the QWERTY keyboard; its limitations are inherited  by the computer keyboard and thence by the design  of today's computer  furniture. 
- **Embodiment of standards:** Modified  by scope and of-ten  by  conflicting  conventions,  infrastructure  takes  on transparency by plugging into other infrastructures  and tools in a standardized  fashion 
- **Built on an installed base:** Infrastructure   does  not grow  de novo:  it  wrestles  with  the  "inertia  of  the  in-stalled  base"  and  inherits  strengths  and  limitations from   that  base.  Optical fibers  run  along  old  rail-road  lines;  new  systems  are  designed  for  backward-compatibility;  and  failing  to  account  for  these  constraints may be fatal  or distorting  to new  development processes.  
- **Becomes visible upon breakdown:**  The normally  invisible  quality  of  working  infrastructure  becomes  visible when  it breaks; the  server  is down,  the bridge  washes out,  there  is  a  power  blackout.  Even when there  are back-up mechanisms or procedures, their existence  further highlights the now-visible  infrastructure. 

## Bringing this together
The complications of web literacy are many. In this session we have tried to understand two: 

- The embarrassment of not knowing
- The web as a sociotechnical infrastructure
